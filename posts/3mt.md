# Three-Minute Thesis: Facilitate Users with Query Formulation  
Date: 2019-11-05

This is a video I made for the [2019-2020 UBC Undergraduate Three-Minute Thesis competition](https://ubc.3mt.ca/). Although my project has changed drastically since then, it was a fun learning experience that challenged me to express my idea in three minutes.

## Feedback from Reviewers

| Reviewer      | Strengths           | Improvements  |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| Reviewer 1      | You did a very good job at ensure the terminology and the concepts were understandable by someone outside of the field. As well, I found the slides visuals to be effective without distracting from the oration.  The delivery of the presentation was very well done, not rushed or ever too slow and kept me engaged the whole time. | It would be very helpful to make the specific research goal more clear at the start of the presentation, and return to this concept 1 or 2 more times throughout the presentation. The analogy was quite good but I think it could be refined a bit further to relate more easily to the outcome of the project. As well, a bit more understanding of the importance of faster database searching for a "newbie" for people outside of the field would be useful to provide more context. A little bit more on specifically what your research/goal involves doing, you did mention this but a bit more time focused on this would help the audience understand what exactly you will be doing.|
| Reviewer 2 | The analogy to the maze is very effective and is a good device for helping non-experts begin to access the topic and problem;  Tone of voice is engaging and well paced; Talk is well-structured and logical. | As someone outside this field I found it difficult to appreciate the perspective of the "user" - as I understand it this research is designed to help users better engage with databases but I am not entirely sure what it means to be a user and/or what types of problems they might be addressing (I watched this twice and the first time through I got a bit lost at minute 2 as you begin to lay out the research). Perhaps grounding the presentation in a specific example that could link back to the maze analogy may have helped to strengthen the relevance. Similarly, I think a different title (written for an out of field audience) could have also helped to engage the audience and helped us to understand the rationale for and relevance of the research. |
